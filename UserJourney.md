Alex, a graduate student frustrated by confusing bank statements and clunky budgeting apps, turns to FlashFinance to make sense of his monthly spending.

After signing up, he creates personal categories like Groceries, Coffee Shops, and Takeout. He then downloads his latest bank statement as a CSV from his bank’s website and uploads it into FlashFinance’s Import Page. The app processes his data and shows which transactions need labeling.

Alex starts a labeling session where transactions appear one by one in a clean quick-pick interface. He taps to assign each purchase to a category option, being aided by the AI-powered suggest feature. When he finishes labeling for the day, he closes the session and his progress is saved automatically.

Back on the categories page, he can see updated transaction histories, as well as new statistics. He’s surprised to see Takeout taking up much more of his budget than he realized, while Groceries stay steady. The process feels quick and satisfying, and for the first time, Alex decides to keep uploading his statements regularly because reviewing his spending finally feels easy and worthwhile.
